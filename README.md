# MyPlanner

This is the repository for the app Portable Planner on the Google Play Store. You can see the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myplanner.myplanner&hl=en). I made it during the spring/summmer of 2016. Unfortunately, at that point I did not know about JavaDoc's, so all the functions are documented using an alternative style. It is not particularly complex, it is just something I put together to learn more about Java and Android Studio for my first coop term.
